# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

With more work experience, I am seeing how disorganizing it really is to be a student without proper planning. I want to somehow create a code to help organize a daily, weekly, monthly, or semesterly schedule to keep students who struggle with task management. I hope to be able to create an aesthetic that is also visually pleasing, even though technology now can replace the original agenda books we use to search the aisles for each year to find the perfect, pink one (in my case).

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I do not plan on collaborating with anyone else other than asking my TA for help when I run into problems

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Am I allowed to refer to outside help as in looking at google APIs to figure out having a csv file for a schedule can be automatically uploaded into mobile/digital calendars with reminders?
